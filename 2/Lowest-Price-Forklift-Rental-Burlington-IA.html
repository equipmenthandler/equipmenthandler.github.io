<p>Aside from these two distinct types of a forklift, there are many other varieties available. Reach forklifts, also known as reach trucks, get their names from the distinctive way in which their fork carriages can ‘reach' into racking. Low noise and vibration, excellent all-round visibility and easy servicing allow for improved driver comfort and forklift truck durability.</p>
<p>13 Low lift trucks may be operated by a person seated on the machine, or by a person walking alongside, depending on the design. Rough terrain forklifts use a telescopic or a standard mast, which can be quite handy when handling a complex-mix of reach and lift. They offer straight forward operation and have dual forks at the front of the truck to lift and transport loads.</p>

The growth of the region is due to the demand for modern material handling equipment across industries such as construction, mining, food, and beverage, etc. If you find anything wrong with the forklift during the walk-around or seated inspection, do not operate it until it has been repaired.</p>

<p>It is impractical to build a guard of sufficient strength to withstand the impact of a falling capacity load since such a guard would constitute a safety hazard because its structure would be so large that it might interfere with good visibility, and would weigh so much that it might make the truck top-heavy and unstable. These Class 5 forklifts, sometimes called Yard Trucks,” are larger when compared to a Cushion tire unit of equal capacity and offer a softer ride.</p>

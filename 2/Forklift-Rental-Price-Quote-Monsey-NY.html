<p>Powerful performance meets compact design. Trucks with a body lift often have a visible gap between the frame and body, which a lot of people find unsightly. This is due to the fact that a used forklift really has no suspension and it is not possible to maintain tire to ground contact in uneven environments. These fees are based on the length of the time you have your rental. The hand pallet truck lift offers load shifting, lifting and lowering functions.</p>
<p>Whether tough outdoor use or classic stacking in the warehouse; whether pallet truck, order picker or narrow aisle truck; if you need to move a few hundredweight or several tons - at Jungheinrich Rental you always get the right truck.

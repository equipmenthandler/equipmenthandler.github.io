<p>Because extreme bounce can be a common problem in lifted trucks, we suggest continuously monitoring the bounce of your lifted truck. Give special consideration to the proper functioning of tires, horn, lights, battery, controller, lift system (including load engaging means, chains, cable, and limit switches), brakes and steering mechanism. However, you will need basic numeracy skills and to be able to speak, read and write in English well enough to do the training and forklift driving licence test explained above.</p>

<p>At the time, Vincent Halma, president and CEO of KION North America, said the rate at which we're releasing new products and services is truly unprecedented.” KION also recently announced plans to expand its South Carolina facility capacity to 12,000 lift trucks a year by 2020, up from 3,000 in 2015. The most obvious benefit is the increased ground clearance when driving over rugged terrain, which reduces the risk of damage to your undercarriage.</p>

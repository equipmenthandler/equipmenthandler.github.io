Likewise, in current scenarios, the diesel forklift trucks are estimated to have an exponential growth rate over the forecast period ranging from the most simple to the advance manufactured Forklift Trucks that includes electronically controlled engines and GPS communication systems.</p>
<p>Reality: the higher a heavy load is lifted, the less safe a forklift becomes.

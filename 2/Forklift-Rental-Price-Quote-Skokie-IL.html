<p>Featuring a hydraulic jack that is manually operated from the handle, the manual pallet jack gets it name from the manual pump input to raise the fork. Thanks to their high capacity of up to three tons and excellent manoeuvrability in even the tightest of spaces, hand pallet trucks represent ideal warehouse aids.

<p>Before settling on what forklift to purchase or rent, be certain you've got a good idea of the weights and dimensions of the loads you intend to lift.

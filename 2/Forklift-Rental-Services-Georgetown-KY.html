<p>A forklift is also known as a lift truck essentially because it's a truck that can lift loads using a set of forks. Begin your inspection facing the front of the forklift. Take a test drive of a lifted GMC truck at our GMC dealership's headquarters as soon as you can. We take pride in offering one of the largest, most up-to-date rental fleets of lift trucks including cushion tire, heavy lift, electric and pick loader lift trucks across Alabama and Northwest Florida. Since electric forklifts use a battery, there are no fuel costs; they operate a great deal more quietly than internal combustion engines and last longer than internal combustion engines because they have less moving parts.</p>
<p>At its 2019 National Forklift Safety Day in Washington, D.C., ITA members discussed how there are currently more than 4.5 million truck operations currently employed in more than 300 industries nationwide. Class VII - Rough terrain forklift trucks comprise Class VII, including straight-mast forklifts and extended-reach forklifts.

From new and used sales to fleet financing solutions to servicing and maintenance, your local Cat lift trucks and warehouse equipment dealer is ready to help when needed. When you choose Thompson Lift Truck as your forklift dealership, you can always count on quality. That is what we have taken that out of the equation for you, with our delivery service for all new machinery and forklift rentals in our range.</p>
<p>Before you decide to lift your truck, it's important to understand some of the pros and cons of driving a lifted vehicle. If your forklift is overloaded, it can cause it to tip to the side when you turn or when you are near a steep edge. Forklifts run on diesel, liquid propane and electric. If you have previously owned a forklift, determine what aspects you liked and didn't like about the lift.</p>
<p>Any time the forklift's center of gravity moves outside the stability triangle, the lift will tip over. Like the pallets themselves, pallet jacks have become a lot more standardized in North America as of late. Southeast Forklifts specializes in high quality, thoroughly inspected and reconditioned equipment you can trust. From the moment you first step into the reception area, decorated with handmade up-cycled furniture built from old pallets to the large warehouse space where the forklifts, order pickers, boom, and scissor lifts all operate, we have made a huge effort for the whole place to be a positive, professional, clean, modern and friendly environment.</p>

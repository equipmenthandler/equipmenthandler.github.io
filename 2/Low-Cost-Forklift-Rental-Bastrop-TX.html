It is also not a substitute for a powered industrial truck operator training program. These calculations take into account variations in design including tire, mast, and other deflections, and provide a means for predicting with reasonable accuracy the stability of fork trucks. The second hand forklifts, offered by us, for buying and selling purposes are in fine working condition and thus, require minimum maintenance.</p>
<p>To obtain a forklift licence in any State or Territory an applicant must undertake a training course with an approved training organisation and then, on completion of the course, apply to the appropriate State or Territory for a forklift licence. If you are not sure how everything works in a lifted truck that you want to test drive, ask questions. Ask your Raymond Handling Concepts Sales Rep about new, used or rental availability of order pickers.</p>

Also, 4,000 lb. trucks use a heavier battery to counteract the heavier load on the forks.

<p>Charges will continue until the equipment is returned to the rental supplier and the equipment is available to be rented to the next customer. You might notice less suspension damping during long trips and on rough, uneven roads, but this only tends to be an issue if you're lifting your truck more than a few inches. We are the Forklift Professionals. For some businesses, hiring or renting forklifts makes more sense than buying it outright.</p>

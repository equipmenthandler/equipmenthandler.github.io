In the UK, the Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations state that operators of forklift trucks must be adequately trained, the general standards of that training and good operating practice are found in the HSE Code of Practice 117 (Third edition) 49 issued in 2013. If the truck is equipped with front-end attachments other than factory installed attachments, the user shall request that the truck be marked to identify the attachments, show the approximate weight of the truck and attachment combination, and the capacity of the truck and attachment combination at maximum elevation with load laterally centered.</p>
<p>This added weight increases the lifting capacity of the unit to between 2,200 and 4,000 lb. The load center is the distance from the forks to the center of gravity of the load. We offer certification on the Counterbalance Forklift from the following awarding bodies: RTITB, NPORS, CPCS, LANTRA.

In the UK, the Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations state that operators of forklift trucks must be adequately trained, the general standards of that training and good operating practice are found in the HSE Code of Practice 117 (Third edition) 49 issued in 2013. If the truck is equipped with front-end attachments other than factory installed attachments, the user shall request that the truck be marked to identify the attachments, show the approximate weight of the truck and attachment combination, and the capacity of the truck and attachment combination at maximum elevation with load laterally centered.</p>

We are known as a 'One Stop Shop' for material handling equipment. The mast shall be at full rearward tilt and the forks the elevated until the point of intersection of the two load-carrying surfaces of the forks is 12 inches from the floor.</p>
<p>The rider pallet jack is the big brother to the electric walk behind pallet jack. As outlined above, yes, bad things can happen when a truck is not lifted properly.

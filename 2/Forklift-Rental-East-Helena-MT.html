<p>There are also variants that features a stand-up forklift, which makes it easier for operators to hop on and off between loads. The user should mark, on the sides of the truck, in letters at least 1Â½ in. high, the actual vehicle weight, the maximum load and the combined weight of the vehicle and capacity load. The 35 Construction Teletruk counterbalance forklift with telescopic boom is a proven cost saver.</p>

Where possible, fork loops or jugs should be provided for handling by fork trucks. Whilst implementing some or all of the relevant measures above will greatly reduce the fall risk to operators, the best solution is to provide order pickers with fully enclosed platforms.</p>

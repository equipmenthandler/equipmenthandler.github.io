<p>Studies have shown that there are roughly 900,000 Rough Terrain Forklifts used every day in U.S. businesses. Citizens are free to install lift kits and after-market wheels, as well as grill guards, performance shocks, and after-market bumpers. The Industrial Truck Association (ITA, ) has defined seven classes of lift trucks, or forklifts, which are defined by the type of engine, work environment, operator position and equipment characteristics. In some cases, you may be looking to expand your business or take on work that requires equipment you don't have, like a forklift.</p>
<p>Increase warehouse and plant space by eliminating the need for stocking parts and providing space to service equipment. Use high-quality assembly from industry's mature suppliers to ensure the function of the truck's power system and its stability. Here at 4 Wheel Parts, we have a huge selection of shock absorbers from the leading brands in the industry such as Pro Comp Suspension, King Shocks and Skyjacker to choose the shock absorber for your off-road vehicle or your daily driver.</p>

Long Term Forklift Rental enables you to work with a minimal amount of equipment reducing the need for spare or surplus equipment. Rental provides the means to obtain the latest technology improving operator satisfaction, WH&S and overall efficiencies. For a more controlled ride that keeps your tires touching the ground beneath you for continuous contact, you need Jeep shocks to replace your old, worn out ones and put you back in control in the driver's seat.</p>
<p>In trucks where the operator stands, a vertical clearance of at least 74 inches should be maintained from the platform where he stands to the underside of the section of the guard under which the operator's head moves during normal operation. Although lifted trucks can make hitting the trail a lot easier, they do have some drawbacks that you want to keep in mind before committing to one.</p>
<p>Beyond that, many workers can also be injured when (1) lift trucks are inadvertently driven off loading docks; (2) lifts fall between docks and an unsecured trailer; (3) they are struck by a lift truck; or (4) they fall while on elevated pallets and tines. While gas forklift types do not need to charge and can operate day or night as long as they have enough fuel, battery operated forklifts need to be properly charged for up to eight hours to be used at maximum capacity.</p>

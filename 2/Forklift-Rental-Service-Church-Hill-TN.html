<p>Scissor lifts provide access for people or equipment to height-restricted areas (up to 90'). Check to make sure that the pallet jack is not on the cross wood of the skid, front wheels must be on the floor. The pallet trucks may be manual or battery-powered. We ensure that we are affordable and always reliable, so you can always count on having the best experience when you service, buy or hire a forklift with us.</p>
<p>Telescopic forks - hydraulic attachments that allow the operator to operate in warehouse design for "double-deep stacking", which means that two pallet shelves are placed behind each other without any aisle between them. To ensure that your pickup truck is secure to ride while off-roading after this type of modification, you need to invest in larger tires.</p>

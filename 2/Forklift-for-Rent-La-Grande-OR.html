If alternate capacities are shown for elevations lower than maximum, alternate capacities not shown may be 2 assumed to fall on a straight line between the capacity and the alternate capacities shown for each load center.</p>
<p>Sit-down forklifts are also more accessible to a wider pool of forklift operators for that reason. Some of these can also save you on the purchase of unnecessary equipment by converting a rough terrain forklift to a number of other heavy industrial machines. Lift Capacity: 6000 lbs.

Using the procedure outlined for this test an empty truck with the forks elevated to the maximum height should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 14 percent or 18 percent slope depending on whether the truck has single, rear-wheel drive (or brake) or dual wheel drive (or brakes), respectively.</p>
<p>This includes, but is not limited to, straddle carriers, hustlers, toploaders, container reach stackers, and other vehicles that carry, push, pull, lift, or tier loads. Place empty truck on initially level test platform in a position that the centerline of the truck is perpendicular to the axis of tilting of the test platform, and with the rear wheels placed in their least stable position.</p>
<p>Although forklifts are fairly easy machines to operate, it is recommended that all drivers receive proper forklift training and certification. If other tests or tests for trucks over 10,000 pounds rated capacity are required, the details should be agreed upon between the interested parties.

<p>A truck that has had its suspension modified so that it rides way too far off the ground, usually to the point where the high center of gravity could actually be dangerous. Limited Free Lift = The amount the forks raise before the overall lowered height of a mast increases. ProControl Account Management by Herc Rentals comes with tools to make your job easier, faster and more rewarding.

Experience proves that operators who are properly trained, keep within the forklift's load capacity, and follow rules of safe operation to avoid tipovers and accidents. In order to prevent the lift from tipping, the combined center of gravity of the load and the lift must stay inside the stability triangle (at ground level) at all times.</p>

<p>Virtually any standard sized truck can be lifted to a certain extent or another. Some pallet jack models are able to lift loads all the way up to 15,000 pounds (6,803 kg). The forklift and load must be considered a unit with a continually varying center of gravity with every movement of the load. The pallet truck is simply for moving loads from one place to another at ground level, but it has limited reach, while the lift truck is more complex and is capable of transporting and lifting a palletised load onto a higher level or for stacking loads on top of each other.</p>
<p>The majority of all rough terrain forklifts will have pneumatic tires since they are designed for traveling outdoors, such as on gravel or in yard work.

<p>TYPES OF FORKLIFTS: fork crane models for industrial use within warehouses, hydraulic three-wheeled electric forklifts, etc. A heavy attachment lowers the amount of weight that the forklift can support. One of the top reasons to consider lifted trucks for sale is because of their rugged good looks. They also invest heavily in the design of their machines to ensure optimal performance even on jobsites that include limited access terrain and high-reach areas. The forklift is designed with a load limit for the forks which is decreased with fork elevation and undercutting of the load (i.e., when a load does not butt against the fork "L").</p>
<p>Asian Engineering Sales Corporation and Associated Equipment Rentals Pvt. We have been buying, building and selling lifted trucks and Jeeps for over ten years, its what we do. We offer the largest selection of used lifted 4×4 trucks for sale in the Chicagoland area, along with a huge selection of hard to find rust free trucks and factory stock trucks for sale.</p>

The smallest of the modern pneumatic style forklifts, the 3,000 lb. pneumatic is ideal for light-duty outdoor applications.

By decreasing the air pressure, the driver can decrease the weight-carrying capacity of the axle or eliminate it completely by raising it up and off of the road. Our used lifted trucks are durable, capable, and ready to handle any of the local trails and provide you the added power in any driving situation.</p>

The load capacity of the forklift will restrict the load capacity of the order picker cages. These kits cannot be installed in vehicles with a unibody construction, such as the Jeep Cherokee.</p>
<p>Our range of Super Short Hand Pallet Truck is scientifically designed to achieve maximum production capacity with minimum human efforts. These types of forklifts are faster and much more powerful than electric forklifts, but are also much louder.

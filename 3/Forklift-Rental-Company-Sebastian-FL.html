<p>Virtually any standard sized truck can be lifted to a certain extent or another. Some pallet jack models are able to lift loads all the way up to 15,000 pounds (6,803 kg). The forklift and load must be considered a unit with a continually varying center of gravity with every movement of the load. The pallet truck is simply for moving loads from one place to another at ground level, but it has limited reach, while the lift truck is more complex and is capable of transporting and lifting a palletised load onto a higher level or for stacking loads on top of each other.</p>
<p>One of the advantages of the rough terrain forklift is that it has more controllable cornering stability even in harsh environments.

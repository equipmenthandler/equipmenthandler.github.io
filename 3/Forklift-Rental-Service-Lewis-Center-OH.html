H&E were founded in 1961 and have been providing equipment rental for more than 50 years.

Our product range includes a wide range of manual hand pallet trucks, hydraulic hand pallet trucks, high lift pallet truck, rough terrain pallet truck, heavy duty pallet truck and rough terrain pallet trucks.

<p>These Class 4 forklifts are one of the most commonly used forklifts in the U.S., typically used indoors for applications such as manufacturing, warehousing, bottling, and trucking. Linear speed control, an option on many competitors' trucks, is standard on all SP models and utilizes a variable height sensor to measure platform height and determine the optimum speed level.</p>
<p>It is designed to lift heavier loads higher in a compact footprint with improved speed and energy efficiency. We are largest supplier and importer of Electric High Lift Pallet Truck. Industrial counterbalance lift trucks are the forklifts that do most of the materials handling work in industrial facilities today. If the type of load presents a hazard, the user shall equip fork trucks with a vertical load backrest extension manufactured in accordance with Part II, 422, of this standard.</p>
<p>In most cases a reach forklift operator sits sideways but there are some forklifts which accommodate a standing operator.

It offers quick acceleration and fast lift speeds to keep your operators moving.</p>

<p>If you have ever ridden in, or driven a lowered truck, you are well aware of that lifted Super Duty coming up from behind with the headlights shining clear above your cab and lighting up the night sky ahead of you, as if you had a roof-mounted lightbar attached to your road grater.

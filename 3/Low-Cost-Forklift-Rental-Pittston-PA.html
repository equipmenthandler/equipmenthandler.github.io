<p>With the rise in popularity of the telehandler, the rough-terrain (RT) forklift has become the lower-cost, more-maneuverable alternative on construction sites. That's why Linde develops entirely individual order pickers based on a modular system, featuring, for example, different mast heights, working platforms, chassis sizes, and operating and control concepts.</p>
<p>The result is simple: once the already-huge truck is lifted to an even huger height, it goes from "somewhat unsafe" to "incredibly scary." Not for the people in the truck, mind you. Whether you're venturing off the beaten path or commuting to work, the higher seating position makes it easier to see further down the road and over other vehicles. If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it's a more expensive method, while a body lift is a cheaper way to get a little more ride height and still improve your truck's off-roading abilities. You typically gain 1-3 inches of ground clearance with a suspension lift kit. Also referred to as a "warehouse forklift," this truck is designed to work indoors on flat ground. Due to the presence of the boom lift, this machine is considered a partially loaded truck even without a load on the attachment.</p>
<p>A lifted truck also has a higher resale value because of how valuable these trucks are. We have used lifted trucks in stock from time-to-time, but we cannot guarantee availability on pre-owned models due to frequent changes in our inventory. As a result, customers should contact our team with questions about these suspension lift kits. The taller tires get the differential higher off the ground, reducing the risk of damage from obstacles, and all four wheels gain maximum traction due to the lifted suspension.</p>
<p>Today's leaders, especially Toyota and KION, continue to expand their reach beyond industrial trucks and into the broader market for supply chain services. As a forklift operator, you don't have to worry about the load center as long as you respect the listed weight capacity and keep the load balanced. There are various hand pallet trucks such as electric hand pallet trucks and hydraulic hand pallet trucks to suit your warehouse needs.</p>

<p>Picking out the right lift kit height means you'll need to know a little bit more about how certain lift heights will affect your vehicle's performance and what they are generally used for. It may be necessary to travel long distances with the load to the rear in reverse for most forklifts. Frequency of use and pallet transport distance should be taken into consideration when choosing between manual and electric pallet trucks.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that there are no set rules for exactly how much a used forklift should price, and a whole lot will also depend on the demand and supply of used forklifts in your town. Generally speaking the reach truck will be less expensive new, used or leased than a sit-down forklift but the real value is in increased warehouse productivity.

<p>Suspension lifts are also found on a number of high performance sports cars, in which a very low ground clearance is used to improve handling, using an aerodynamic effect known as downforce; examples include the Ferrari 488, Lamborghini Huracan, McLaren 720S, and the second generation Ford GT. Such vehicles activate the suspension lift while traversing road bumps and ramps to avoid damaging the front underbody of the vehicle when driving on public roads; the suspension lift is deactivated on race tracks and level roads.</p>
<p>This German company is arguably the best material handling organization in Europe. Masts with two, three, or even four sections allow choosing a lift height best suited to particular operations, and the free-lift feature offered on some masts (allowing the forks to raise without extending the mast) makes working in low-overhead situations much easier. Forklift Manufacturers are generally happy to send a Sales Representative, who is well versed in specific forklift applications, to your facility to survey your specific application and make recommendations on product types This information can be extremely valuable in reducing forklift expenses and operational costs.</p>
<p>We also operate three trucks for parts collection in Johannesburg and share the use of a warehouse facility in Jet Park for these conditions. For example a panto-graph reach forklift utilizes a scissor mechanism, allowing it to reach into racking with either a single or double reaching design. On the other hand, Europe is projected to witness significant growth in the global forklift trucks market.</p>

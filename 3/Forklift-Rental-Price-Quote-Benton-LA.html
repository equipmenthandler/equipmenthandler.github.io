<h2>Industrial Forklift Trucks Benton </h2>
<p>If you rent forklift then it will work as a power based truck to lift and move industrial and raw materials. Experience proves that operators who are properly trained, keep within the forklift's load capacity, and follow rules of safe operation to avoid tipovers and accidents. In order to prevent the lift from tipping, the combined center of gravity of the load and the lift must stay inside the stability triangle (at ground level) at all times.</p>
<p>Depending on your needs, purchasing equipment may not make sense, MH Equipment features one of the largest material handling and construction equipment rental fleets in the Midwest. This is very important to the safety of the forklift operator. LOAD CENTER: The horizontal longitudinal distance from the intersection of the horizontal load-carrying surfaces and vertical load-engaging faces of the forks (or equivalent load positioning structure) to the center of gravity of the load.</p>

Rough-terrrain lifts are particularly prone to abuse if they were employed at a construction site.</p>

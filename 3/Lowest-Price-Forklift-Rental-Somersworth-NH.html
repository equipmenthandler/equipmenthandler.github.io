<h2>Lift Truck Safety Somersworth</h2>
<p>Forklifts are powered industrial trucks used to lift and move materials in short distances. Operators get excellent visibility with panoramic views of rack, loads and aisle.

Our experienced service technicians are ready and able to repair all makes and models of forklifts.</p>

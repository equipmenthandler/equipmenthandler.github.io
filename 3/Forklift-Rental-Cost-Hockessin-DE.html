<p>At Frank Kent CDJR, we have used lifted trucks for sale, and our expert service staff can install lift kits into one of our new or used pickups for you. For instance, KION North America Corp., Summerville, S.C., released three new Linde electric pallet trucks delivering load capacities of 2,600-4,500 pounds. Buying diesel forklifts are the other option and are easy to refuel.</p>

<p>The maximum capacity of reach forklifts is generally around 5,000 pounds. The weight of the forklift's battery can also be used to provide stability to the truck, so any change in the type of battery for the forklift can lead to instability. The Hydraulic hand Pallet trucks can handle palletised load up to 2500 Kg in a single haul and a single operator can lift and move this weight effortlessly over short distances.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we offer our customers the possibility of covering their machinery damage with STILL Rental Plus. This is the total amount of weight the forklift can move off the ground. The smallest of the modern pneumatic style forklifts, the 3,000 lb. pneumatic is ideal for light-duty outdoor applications.

<p>We have access to many brands, so we will have a Forklift solution that fits your requirements. We are a full-service forklift and material handling equipment dealer, proudly located in Phoenix and serving the great state of Arizona. This course covers how to safely and efficiently operate a rough terrain forklift, how to educate and evaluate other operators on their rough terrain forklift performance, identifying when and how to service and maintain forklifts and how to keep other workers around the forklift area safe.</p>
<p>This allows it to lift small loads into tight spaces. This allows for completion of work at heights that normal forklifts cannot reach. Generally, a lifted truck has the main frame and chassis raised up one or more feet above where it would normally sit on top of the tires. Be sure to find out what kind of warranty exists on the forklift. In addition to a control to raise and lower the forks (also known as blades or tines), the operator can tilt the mast to compensate for a load's tendency to angle the blades toward the ground and risk slipping off the forks.</p>

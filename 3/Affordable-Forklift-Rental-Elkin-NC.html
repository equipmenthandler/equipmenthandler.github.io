Service brakes shall enable the truck to develop a drawbar drag equal to a percent of the gross vehicle weight (with rated capacity load) per the second column of the table on next page, while the truck is being towed slowly in either direction. From the wide-open operator window to its rock solid stability system, Crown's SP Series order pickers are designed to help busy order pickers maintain confidence at height and efficiently handle a variety of tasks.</p>
<p>The trucks make light work of heavy loads, while the scales impress with their outstanding precision. The correct capacity will narrow your used forklift for sale search down to a couple of models. Smaller in size when compared to pneumatic tire forklift of equal capacity.

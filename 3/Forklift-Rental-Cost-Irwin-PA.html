<p>Some order pickers actually load their pallets into trucks. Drivers in lifted trucks need to be especially vigilant for anybody entering or exiting their blind spots. It gets a lot more complicated when we add the weight of a load to the forklift, and raise that load in the air. When the first mast reaches maximum height, the second mast will extend. If you are lacking capital to purchase a forklift, or fleet of forklifts, we have flexible financing options available to help you secure the equipment that you need now.</p>

Many of the hazards posed by forklifts can be mitigated with custom signage and clear visual communication.</p>

To make the Wrangler even more adventurous and exciting, consider a Rocky Ridge Lifted version, which will have all the enhancements you need to boost ground clearance and have even more confidence when on a trail.</p>
<p>As the hydraulic jack at the 'tiller' end is raised, the links force the wheels down, raising the forks vertically above the front wheels, raising the load upward until it clears the floor. If your employer deems this certification to be sufficient enough to operate the forklift safely and properly, they will grant you a license. The top supplying country or region is China, which supply 100% of all terrain forklifts respectively.</p>

An overhead guard is intended to offer protection from the impact of small packages, boxes, bagged material, etc., representative of the job application, but not to withstand the impact of a falling capacity load.

<h3>Electric Forklift For Sale Used Spring Hill KS</h3>
<p>Short-term requirements - If you only use the equipment to smooth out business operations during busy months or for a limited period, buying a forklift might be too costly. If you already have one of our electric forklift trucks, it can be easily retrofitted with lithium-ion power. They are also sometimes referred to as pallet trucks, pallet pumps, and pump trucks.</p>
<p>Given their job description and different types of conditions to deal with, order pickers need to be OSHA compliant with their training. Short Term forklift rental solutions can help you react immediately to a situation with a predicted cost.

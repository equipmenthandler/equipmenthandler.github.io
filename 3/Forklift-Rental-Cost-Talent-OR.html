Their upfront price is the inverse of electric, making IC forklifts initially cheaper than electric models, but they cost more per hour to run. At Durante Rentals, we rent forklifts and telehandlers for all your material handling needs.</p>

In this guide, we'll show you how to choose the correct shocks for a truck equipped with a lift kit.</p>

They work closely with independently-owned equipment rental yards, bringing everything together in one place.</p>
<p>But where a straight mast forklift really differs is in the maneuverability and accessibility it provides through large heavy-duty pneumatic cushion tires that enable the lift to traverse rough terrain as easily as any other equipment on the job site.

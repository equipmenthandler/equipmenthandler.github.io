Servicing industries including roadwork, forestry, agriculture, stock picking and more, we're Northern California's go-to source for Cat, Clark, Mitsubishi and other allied brand forklifts.

This makes the global pallet truck market fragmented in nature. A pallet jack scale or a pallet truck scale can typically lift 120 mm.</p>

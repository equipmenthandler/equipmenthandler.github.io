<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. We provide UniCarriers Forklifts including stand up and sit down trucks from 3,000 to 15,500 lb. They have the ability to reach loads that sit up high and can extend to distances beyond their stabilising legs. Compared to a forklift, these machines have a smaller capacity. Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>
<p>This range includes the quintessential Electric Pallet Trucks and Electric Platform Trucks, designed to enhance productivity, ensure safety and optimize returns. Powered by large, heavy lead-acid batteries, electric forklifts typically provide enough power for one standard eight-hour shift or about five to six hours of continuous use.

<p>In digging around facts about a forklift rental company, some things you might consider are the company's service level agreements, the age and condition of their forklifts available for rent, as well as the questions they ask to rental enquiries. Standard forklifts generally measure between 4 to 7 ft wide and 8 to 10 ft long. Knowing your required lift height is equally important and will affect your unit's load-carrying capacity.</p>

<p>It's not as easy to see vehicles around your lifted truck, especially if they're smaller passenger occupant vehicles or bikes. Like an articulated forklift, a pivoting-mast forklift can rotate its mast at a 90-degree angle to its body. That's why it's nice to rent a forklift when required.

<p>Powerful performance meets compact design. Trucks with a body lift often have a visible gap between the frame and body, which a lot of people find unsightly. This is due to the fact that a used forklift really has no suspension and it is not possible to maintain tire to ground contact in uneven environments. These fees are based on the length of the time you have your rental. The hand pallet truck lift offers load shifting, lifting and lowering functions.</p>
<p>With capacities ranging from 2,500 to 36,000 pounds, Cat Lift Trucks delivers fuel-efficient lift trucks for greater productivity and advanced electric forklifts with longer run times and a lower total cost of ownership.

The lift truck market value and volume are contributed by the revenue and the forklift truck units sold across North America, Asia Pacific, Middle-East Africa and Latin America. If you're working outdoors, a gas forklift may make sense, but the introduction of the electric forklift has fundamentally changed warehouse usage.</p>
<p>Here's how it works: to create a lifted truck, you take a normal truck (which was developed for agricultural purposes but is now primarily used to see over minivans in traffic) and you put a "lift kit" on it. I am not an expert on lift kits, but based on my personal observation, they offer sizes like "six inches," or "eight inches," or "tall enough to provide storm shelter for a herd of Black Rhinoceros." That one's a big seller here in the South.</p>
<p>Any time the forklift's center of gravity moves outside the stability triangle, the lift will tip over. Like the pallets themselves, pallet jacks have become a lot more standardized in North America as of late. Southeast Forklifts specializes in high quality, thoroughly inspected and reconditioned equipment you can trust. From the moment you first step into the reception area, decorated with handmade up-cycled furniture built from old pallets to the large warehouse space where the forklifts, order pickers, boom, and scissor lifts all operate, we have made a huge effort for the whole place to be a positive, professional, clean, modern and friendly environment.</p>

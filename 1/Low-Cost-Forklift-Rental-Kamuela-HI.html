Even if you've never walked into a warehouse or never even seen a forklift or order picker, our training caters to all types of skill levels. Ask your Raymond Handling Concepts Sales Rep about new, used or rental availability of lift trucks and other materials handling equipment.</p>

We have seen that business owners who use a hand pallet truck give much productivity per day. This machine is designed with a low stowed height to allow for superior maneuverability through entryways. Raymond stand up and sit down forklifts come equipped with exclusive features and technologies, delivering superior visibility, exceptional ergonomics, and unmatched efficiency.</p>
<p>Some new equipment dealerships may have used forklifts that were part of a trade-in. Sometimes the outriggers on a standard walkie reach truck can get in the way of picking loads up. To get around this issue, the counterbalanced stacker has a longer chassis to increase leverage. Forklifts are responsible for only 1% of all warehouse or factory accidents. Our experienced service technicians are ready and able to repair all makes and models of forklifts.</p>
<p>Raymond pallet trucks execute versatile dock, horizontal and low-level order picking warehouse activities with five different available productsâ€”end rider, center rider, enclosed end rider, motorized walkie and tow tractor. You can avoid these charges by utilizing your own LP Gas tanks or filling up the fuel tanks prior to returning the rental equipment. In a warehouse, a forklift can navigate tight spaces, reaching areas that other vehicles cannot.</p>

Many locations have specialized car dealerships that work with modified vehicles such as lifted trucks. The reach truck typically works as part of a material-handling system where two requirements are equally important: cube utilization (ratio of occupied space to total cubic space available, usually expressed as a percentage) and selectivity (amount or percentage of product in a warehouse which is accessible to the aisle for picking).</p>
<p>Other narrow aisle trucks include stand up straddles, swing masts, side loaders, and turret trucks. Lifting loads became an easier process, and the addition of a crane helped workers to pack forklifts quickly. The suspension lift kit helps drivers conquer uneven and off-road terrain.

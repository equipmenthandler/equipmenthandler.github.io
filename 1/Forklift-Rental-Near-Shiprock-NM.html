<p>The standard lift kit raises your truck higher off the ground with affecting how it handles. Side Loader forklifts have been popular in the past as they were the first forklift designed specifically for long load handling. Unfortunately for those who want the Rocky Ridge bumpers on their Jeep but don't necessarily care about the rest of the lift kit, they are not available as a separate option.</p>
<p>Virtually any standard sized truck can be lifted to a certain extent or another. Some pallet jack models are able to lift loads all the way up to 15,000 pounds (6,803 kg). The forklift and load must be considered a unit with a continually varying center of gravity with every movement of the load. The pallet truck is simply for moving loads from one place to another at ground level, but it has limited reach, while the lift truck is more complex and is capable of transporting and lifting a palletised load onto a higher level or for stacking loads on top of each other.</p>
<p>When it is necessary to omit the overhead guard, special attention should be given by the user and operator to conditions such as height and stability of loads and stacks, weight of individual units, and operating space including overhead obstructions. Whether you use rough terrain forklifts every day or once in awhile, these machines can handle major wear and tear.</p>

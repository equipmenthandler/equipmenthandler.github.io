Pallet jacks can bear a lot of weight, but they also have limits that cannot be safely exceeded.</p>
<p>Lifted trucks have a negative reputation for being unsafe, but that's simply untrue. This determines how heavy of a load the forklift can handle, and at what different heights. The LHM200SC pallet truck in the BT Lifter L-series is equipped with a scale to provide high-accuracy weighing during the material handling process. Lifted truck maintenance services require assessment of your brakes, shocks, wheels, as well as tires.</p>

<p>This is critical because loads longer than 48‚Äù will reduce the rated lifting capacity of your rental forklift. Maintenance personnel may be lifted on the forks to reach their work.

If you are driving aggressively in a lifted vehicle, it is a lot easier to spot the infraction and track your lifted truck down.</p>

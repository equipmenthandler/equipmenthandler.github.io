Not move the truck and remain at the controls at all times, if operating an industrial lift truck with a forklift platform with an employee on the platform.

Lifted trucks get instant attention on the streets, and if you're looking for off-road performance, the extra ground clearance in a lifted truck can mean the difference between an exciting run, and walking home.</p>

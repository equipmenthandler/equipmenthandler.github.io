<p>Based on region, the global pallet truck market can be segmented into North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Middle East & Africa, and South America. That's very good for an electric forklift.

And the money you save by leasing can be put into what matter most: growing the business.</p>

<p>The forklift driver training will cover all the key areas; such as Health and Safety Executive (HSE) legislation and safety guidelines, an introduction to the forklift truck, how to start, stop and basic maneuvering, operating with pallets and loads, and difficult loads. A body lift will retain all of the factory suspension and alignment. Particularly in confined conditions, our electric reach trucks set new benchmarks thanks to their compact construction and outstanding lifting capacity.</p>
<p>These rough terrain forklifts come with a higher ground clearance that is crucial to work on cross-country terrain.

To achieve worker safety, Raymond developed the Raymond virtual reality (VR) simulator , a supplemental educational tool that helps new and experienced operators learn and practice forklift operating skills on an actual truck in a secure, warehouse environment. They feature specially-designed lifting carriages and come in two configurations: with mast and with reach.</p>
<p>Vertical masted rough terrain forklifts - If you're looking for a forklift that can be driven on uneven, muddy, or rough surfaces, this is the truck you need. Because of an intelligent man-machine interface, these versatile trucks offer enhanced visibility, acceleration and lift control, all of which are simple to programme. The Herc Rental fleet is worth more than $3 billion.</p>
<p>Furthermore, these rough terrain forklifts double as workhorses in the bush here in Australia. The test load should be equivalent to an unrestrained, homogeneous cube, the dimensions of which are twice the rated load center dimension, and should equal in weight to the rated capacity of the truck. Similar to a reach truck, the electric variety is only for indoor use.</p>

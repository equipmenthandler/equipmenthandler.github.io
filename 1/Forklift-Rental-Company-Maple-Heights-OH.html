<p>This is the most common type of forklift driver, so once you have your licence you will be a highly employable candidate in the transport and logistics industry. Reliable Toyota Industrial engines offer faster acceleration and lift speeds, increasing productivity during stacking, loading and unloading goods, as well as horizontal transport functions.

If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>

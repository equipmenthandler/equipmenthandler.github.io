<p>The Southeast team has an independent network of 2500 + independent buyers of forklifts. The purchase of high-quality industrial machinery is a big investment, no matter the size of your business. This kit is designed for drivers who want to install larger tires on their truck for high-level performance off-road. The most maneuverable of the bunch, and also one of the most fun to operate, reach trucks are designed for warehouse applications and other locations that routinely stack palletized goods in racking or other storage areas.</p>
<p>Report damaged or excessively worn pallet jacks. Choose a jack pallet scale from METTLER TOLEDO that will withstand regularly heavy industrial use. The most basic piece of material handling equipment is the hand pallet truck. Saddle Trucks: Saddle trucks also have long forks but they have the ability to grip onto the edges of the load for increase stability. The only difference is a slightly heavier counterweight that gives the extra 500 lb. capacity to the truck.</p>
<p>For example, a forklift with a 10,000-pound (4,540 kg) lift capacity is limited to a maximum lift height of 20 feet (6 m) and a maximum forward reach of 8 feet (2 m) when lifting a full 10,000-pound load.

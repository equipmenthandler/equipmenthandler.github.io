Southeast Forklifts specializes in high quality, thoroughly inspected and reconditioned equipment you can trust.

Place empty truck on an initially level platform in a position such that the centerline of the truck is perpendicular to the axis of tilting of the platform, and with the rear wheels placed in their least stable position.</p>

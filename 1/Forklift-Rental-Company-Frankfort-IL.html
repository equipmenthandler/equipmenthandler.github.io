<p>Forklift is a small industrial vehicle, having a power operated forked platform attached at the front that can be raised and lowered for insertion under a cargo to lift or move it. Forklifts serve the needs of various industries including warehouses and other large storage facilities. In the United States, approximately one person is killed in a forklift accident every 3 days on average. Therefore, the driving experience behind the wheel of cheap used lifted trucks for sale is unlike anything else. Class 4 forklift, primarily used indoors on smooth surfaces, commonly warehouse operations transporting 2,000 - 90,000lbs.

An electrically powered walkie stacker, for loads 2,000 - 4,000lbs, in which the electrical fittings and equipment are designed to be used in atmospheres containing specifically named flammable vapors, dusts, and under certain conditions, fibers.</p>
<h2>Pallet Stacker Frankfort</h2>
<p>Although the test load must not be restrained in any manner that will affect the deflection of the forks or mast, or free movement of truck, as the platform is tilted, the test load should be secured against possible sliding on the forks in order to sustain an accurate load center and for safety reasons in case the truck tips past the balance point.</p>

Pallet trucks are the efficient and simple mode of transporting palletized loads on the shop floor.

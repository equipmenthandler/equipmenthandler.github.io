There are many attachments that can be purchased to go along with used rough terrain forklifts.</p>

Forklift capacities often range from 3,000 - 7,000 lbs, meaning you can load at least 1,600 lbs on your pallet with the order picker.</p>

The hydraulic forks spread up to 2.22 metres gives excellent possibilities to handle long loads such as steel beams and plastic pipes but also conventional pallets.

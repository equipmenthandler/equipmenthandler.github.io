<p>These are Sit-down forklifts designed for indoor use with solid, cushioned tires — powered by internal-combustion (IC) engines that run on diesel fuel or, more commonly, LP gas.

Since they can easily move from indoor to exterior jobs, these machines are remarkably flexible.</p>

<p>At least 22% of these deaths were caused by forklift overturns and another 20% to workers on foot being struck by the forklift.

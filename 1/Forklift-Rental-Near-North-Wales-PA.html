<p>Forklift is a powered industrial truck used to lift and move materials in warehouses and yards.

We have used lifted trucks in stock from time-to-time, but we cannot guarantee availability on pre-owned models due to frequent changes in our inventory. As a result, customers should contact our team with questions about these suspension lift kits. The taller tires get the differential higher off the ground, reducing the risk of damage from obstacles, and all four wheels gain maximum traction due to the lifted suspension.</p>
<p>These types of kits suspend the frame, body, engine, and the powertrain all above the wheels. Again, it largely will depend on the nature of your business, your warehouse size and specifically what you intend to use the forklift for.
